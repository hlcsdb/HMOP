Notes:

- The ultimate goal is for someone to be able to input a Halkomelem word(s) in practical orthography in curly, straight or APA and the program:
	- ✓ Determine the grammatical category

	- ✓ Determine if there's l-infixation
	- ✓ Determine if there's aspirated resonant copying
	- ✓ Determine if there's reduplication
	- ✓ Determine if there's ablaut on:
		- ✓ the copy vowel
		- ✓ the copied vowel
		- any other vowel in the lexeme stem (distinguish between ablaut due the addition of an affix, or anything else)
	- ✓ Determine if there's metathesis with vowels
	- Determine if there's metathesis with consonants
	- Determine if there are any changes to glottalization

	- (✓ for all checked above) Determine where in the word any of the above processes exist
	- Determine which processes associate with which grammatical category

- make a web-app for individual words. 
- People only need to enter the lexeme, the program will search the parse dictionary for the parse... if we use the apa dictionary with curly, straight and apa then we can search for the curly lexeme from whatever orthography was inputted

Would be super cool to train a neural net...
